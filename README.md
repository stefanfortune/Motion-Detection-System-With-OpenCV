**Advanced Motion Detection System**

A Python-based motion detection system using OpenCV and Tkinter for GUI.

**What it does:**

This project provides a motion detection system that uses a camera to capture video feed and detect motion in real-time. The system uses OpenCV for video processing and Tkinter for creating a user-friendly GUI. The system can be configured to log motion events and display debug windows.

**Features:**

* Real-time motion detection using OpenCV
* User-friendly GUI using Tkinter
* Configurable sensitivity, minimum contour area, and motion persistence
* Option to log motion events to a CSV file
* Option to display debug windows for processing stages

**How to use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application by executing `python Motion_detecton_GUI.py`.
4. The GUI will launch, displaying the video feed from the default camera.
5. Use the controls in the GUI to configure the motion detection settings.
6. Click the "Start Detection" button to start the motion detection process.
7. The system will display a message in the status bar when motion is detected.
8. To log motion events, check the "Enable Logging" checkbox and specify a log file location.
9. To display debug windows, check the "Show Debug Windows" checkbox.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV 4.x
* Tkinter
* NumPy
* Pillow

**Troubleshooting:**

* Make sure the camera is properly connected and configured.
* Adjust the motion detection settings to optimize performance.
* Check the log file for errors or issues.
